Description:
This program implements a chaining hash table to categorize and store string tokens loaded from a single input file. It also includes a custom hash function for sorting each string into the corresponding slot in the hash table. The program prints out the contents of the hash table's first slots, the lengths of every slot, and the standard deviation of all the hash table slot lengths.

1. Compile the program using the provided Makefile. (that only has one command :()
2. Run the program with the command: ./encoder < inputs/input.txt
3. Replace inputs/input.txt with the path to your input file to test with different cases.

I does work on general.asu.edu for me!
